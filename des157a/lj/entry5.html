            <p>In “<a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a>,” Amir Dori shares his knowledge of game design through his experience working with over 250 mobile games. The first item Dori breaks down are locations on the screen that range from easy to hard to reach for the user. He says that adding interaction that can “lead to monetization,” are ideal to place in easy to reach areas on the screen. This includes the store button where users can spend real money for in-game rewards, ads, and links to more apps. Next, Dori discusses how sliders are a good way to add more content within a limited screen space.</p>

            <p>He also talks about pop-ups, which are very similar to overlays. He says to add animation for pop-ups, such as scaling up the window, and having a dim background behind pop-ups. Furthermore, do not have two buttons that carry out the same action, such as having both an “x” button and a “done” button. If you are giving the user two choices, the decision that you want the user to choose should be on the right side, such as confirming a purchase, or sharing the game to social media.</p>

            <p>Another topic Dori discusses is an intro video. If you decide to implement an intro video, it should not be longer than 20 seconds. Furthermore, it should not play upon every start up of the game, only the first time, but should still be accessible to view again. Also, only show the skip button when the user asks for it, such as tapping the screen. If the user does not interact with the skip button, make it disappear so that the user is not pressured to feel impatient and tap the skip button.</p>

            <p>He also discusses other topics that are specific to mobile games.</p>
