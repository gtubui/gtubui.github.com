            <p><b>Project Summary</b>: For my final project, I am reiterating my “Game On!” project that is based off the Nintendo game, <i>Animal Crossing</i>.</p>

            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p><b>Comparison Project 1</b>: The first game I am analyzing is Yahtzee on playonlinedicegames.com. The specific game I have chosen from this website is “Yahtzee.” The game interface is comprised of three columns, the first column contains the game graphics, the second column is the score, and the third column is the game rules. At the top of the page is a nav bar, and at the bottom, in the footer, are social media links, copyright, privacy policy, and links to other games. Overall, the layout of the website seems pretty unappealing, as there is not much visual cohesion with the elements of the page. However, it does well in grouping each element of the game. For some reason, the game start is at the button page, rather than the top. Furthermore, there is no indication that the dice can be interacted with, such as the cursor turning to the pointer. I also do not know how to get the bot to work for the opposing player, so the game seems like it may be broken. The drop shadow and gradient effects for some of the elements give the game a very old Windows XP vibe.</p>

            </figure>
            <p><b>Comparison Project 2</b>: The second game I am analyzing is Death Dice Overdose on armorgames.com. Upon loading the game, you are greeted with very loud explosions, the volume at which matches the THX sound effect that would play on the VCR way back when. Needless to say, I should not have been wearing earphones. However, this really does catch the user’s attention. When hovering over the game options, the text highlights and slightly shifts up, and there is also a noise effect. For the actual game itself, the gist of the game is that you are a stick figure that you control with the arrow keys. The objective is to avoid the dice falling from the sky as long as possible, scoring points until you die when a dice hits and kills you. When you enter the game, intense music plays that makes you want to keep replaying the game for the music itself. When you die, a death noise plays that sounds like a man grunting. Overall, the game seems very put together despite it being a “simple” game. The visual and audio feedback is spot on, the layout of the elements is well done, and the font choice is also very fitting.</p>

            <p><b>Project Goals</b>: The goal of my project is to create a game that is fun and entertaining as well as displays strong visual hierarchy and possesses overall cohesion. Like “Yahtzee,” I will be utilizing dice in a traditional way, whereas “Death Dice Overdose” uses dice in a very different way. Unlike the “Yahtzee” game I played, I want my layout to look more cohesive, or achieve at least some sort of success that “Death Dice Overdose” was able to achieve.</p>

            <p><b>Design Strategies</b>: Colors will be based off of <i>Animal Crossing</i>’s color palette. The website header will be using the same font as the official <i>Animal Crossing</i> logo. The body text is Nunito Sans. Hierarchy will be utilized to give the viewer visual indication as to what to pay attention to on the page. Proximity will also be utilized to allow the viewer to differentiate which objects on the page are associated with each other. Visual and audio cues will be given so that the users know what is able to be interacted with. Background music will be provided as an option to allow for more immersion.</p>

            <p><b>Interaction Strategies</b>: The game’s interface is split into three “screens.” The first screen is for user input (player names, avatar selection, and music choice). Player names are entered through the use of text inputs. Avatar selection will utilize arrow buttons that allow the users to cycle through a selection of avatars. The music options will be presented through radio buttons. To move forward to the next screen, the users interact with a “continue” button that takes them to the rules page. Upon entering the rules page, the music starts and a character(Isabelle from <i>Animal Crossing</i>) walks across the screen and then presents the rules to the users. Once the users are done reading the rules, a “Start the Game!” button can be clicked in order to take them to the game. The game page has two buttons at the top right that allows the users to view the rules again, and also adjust their settings. The game itself has a “Gift” and “Pass” button that changes to a “Start a New Game?” button when either player wins. The player interaction interface is located on the right, while on the left are the “villager” graphics that the players are trying to “befriend.”</p>

            <p><b>Experience Goals</b>: The overall goal of the project is to create a fun, entertaining, seamless, and immersive experience for the user, especially if they are familiar with <i>Animal Crossing</i>, but also regardless of if they are familiar with the game as well. In other words, while the game may seem more exciting to those who are familiar with <i>Animal Crossing</i> because they are familiar with the characters and other aspects of the game, prior knowledge of the game is not needed in order to enjoy the game.</p>
