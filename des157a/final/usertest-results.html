            <p id="testingP"><b>Testing Process:</b> Testers were given 2 minutes to test the game before being able to communicate with them.</p>

            <h3>Tester 1</h3>
            <h4>During testing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Turned up volume a lot on first page after selecting music (I had to whisper to them "it might be loud" in fear that the music would blast once the game started...)</li>
                <li>Said "so cute" multiple times</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Thoughts after testing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Really shows you put a lot of work in it</li>
                <li>"Amazing how you were able to stick with the theme of <i>Animal Crossing</i> [through code and design]"</li>
                <li>Timmy and Tommy placeholders for player name inputs added to the <i>Animal Crossing</i> theme and was a good indicator for what to write in the field (as opposed to just putting "Player 1" and "Player 2")</li>
                <li>Background music is super cute</li>
                <li>Could make a pop up like a text bubble that says "rules" when the user hovers over the info button so that they know it's for the rules</li>
                <li>Hard to tell which face the dice is supposed to be read</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tester 2</h3>
            <h4>During testing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Spent a long time on rules page</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Thoughts after testing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Suggested there be a built-in legend key on the game interface to keep track of how the scoring works</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tester 3</h3>
            <h4>During testing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There was a single die on the screen at some point, not really sure how that happened (supposed to be four dice at all times, maybe a glitch?)</li>
                <li>Pass button seems like it has confused all three testers</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Thoughts after testing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"I really like the visuals, they're very in tune with your <i>Animal Crossing</i> inspo and the little character animations are so cute, especially the speech bubbles"</li>
                <li>"I wish the buttons were stylized to fit the <i>Animal Crossing</i> aesthetic more because everything else looks so cohesive and nice"</li>
                <li>"It'd be nice if there was a field that showed you how much you rolled"</li>
                <li>Put characters from the home page on the game interface</li>
                <li>"Your dice are beautiful"</li>
                <li>"The user flow was very clear"</li>
                <li>"I wish there was a quit button on the game screen"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Questions with answers:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Should the score be allowed to go into the negatives?
                    <ul>
                        <li>No</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If a settings button were implemented, what do you think should go in it?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Music choice</li>
                        <li>Option to mute sound</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Should the "roll the dice" button be merged with the "gift" button?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes because it is confusing</li>
                        <li>Maybe make the game have only one button for "gift"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Should the buttons be styled differently? If so, what would you recommend?
                    <ul>
                        <li>It might be better to keep it that style since the background is busy and colorful</li>
                        <li>Could try matching the style of the text bubbles</li>
                        <li>Match the <i>Animal Crossing</i> theme more</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How could the game layout be improved?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't see any need for improvement</li>
                        <li>Maybe merge the dice and score column</li>
                        <li>Add a quit/restart button and add the characters under the names</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Are there any other characters youâ€™d like to see in the game?
                    <ul>
                       <li>Marshal and Apple</li> 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Any other comments or suggestions?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hard to tell whose turn it is</li>
                        <li>Maybe add a label for the music choice on the home page, because it might be difficult to tell that they're song choices</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p id="testconclusion"><b>Conclusion:</b> I got a lot of great feedback for the last iteration of my final project.</p>
            <h4>What I need to definitely implement:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Either merging the roll and gift buttons, or all three buttons</li>
                <li>Preventing the score from going into the negatives</li>
                <li>More clearly highlighting whose turn it is</li>
                <li>Showing what the players rolled</li>
                <li>Making the rules more readable / easier to understand</li>
                <li>Re-skin dice to make them easier to read</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What I can most likely realistically implement within the time constraint but is not entirely needed:<h4></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding the player characters to the game interface</li>
                <li>Build-in legend/key for dice rolls</li>
                <li>Marshal and Apple villagers</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What I would like to implement but might have a hard time achieving, and therefore may not be able to implement in time:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Text bubbles that says "rules" when the user hovers over the info button</li>
                <li>Settings overlay/button</li>
