                <p>The first game that came to mind when thinking of a project with a similar concept was <i>Kind Words</i>. I haven’t actually played the game, but I’ve seen it pop-up in my recommended games to play several times before. The overall gist of the game is that people are able to anonymously submit concerns or simply vent and it will send this letter to other people who are able to respond to you. The game’s setting is a 3d perspective cutout of a bedroom. The artstyle is very aesthetically appealing and calming to the viewer, giving off a very “cozy vibe.” Furthermore, along with sending letters, the game also allows players to collect stickers and send them to friends, adding another layer of gameplay / immersion. The game interface also feels very spacious and minimalist, as it utilizes simple buttons for user interaction.</p>

            <h2><a href=”https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/”>Inscryption</a></h2>
            <div class="divFlex">
                <p>Another game that comes to mind is <i>Inscryption</i>. While the game is primarily a card-based game, it also ventures into a wide variety of genres such as roguelikes, escape-room style puzzles, 2d pixel exploration, and much more. The game truly tests the limits of breaking the 4th dimension that cannot really be explained unless you experience it yourself (through watching gameplay or playing it – personally I watched <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxW84qnvZEc&ab_channel=Markiplier”>Markiplier</a> play it). However, the reason I chose this game as my second comparison is because of a specific feature that the game provides in Act 3 during one of the boss fights. In this boss fight, the game utilizes data from the player’s Steam(a game client) profile. Soon after the battle starts, the boss will deploy cards that contain information from their friend’s list. Additionally, the player is also able to create their own card that is then sent to another player who is also fighting this boss at the same exact time, and vice versa. I thought it was super interesting how the developers were able to integrate this real-time interaction between other players into a game that is primarily singleplayer. Also, the creation of a card that is then viewed / used by another player reminded me of the examples that we were shown in class.</p>
