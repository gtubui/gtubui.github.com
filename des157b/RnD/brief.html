    <p><b>Project Summary:</b> My project will be focusing on normalizing and humanizing the LGBTQ+ community through the use of an indie video game-esque interface.</p>

    <p><b>Project Goals:</b> The project has two goals — to help normalize and humanize the LGBTQ+ community by gathering a collection of thoughts that will hopefully bring to light different perspectives that will allow others to accept those within the LGBTQ+ community, and also provide a source of comfort and acceptance to those who are part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

    <p><b>Design Strategies:</b> I will be utilizing 2d pixel graphics that mimic an indie video game feel. The typographic choice will be “Press Start 2P” from Google Fonts to enhance the video game vibe.</p>

    <p><b>Interaction Strategies:</b> Ideally, the user will be able to control a character that can either move left or right with the ability to interact with NPCs (non-playable characters). Each NPC has a special role. As of now, I intend to implement an NPC for 1) user input for collecting their thoughts, 2) data display for displaying the collection of thoughts that have been previously inputted, 3) information regarding historical LGBTQ+ figures, and 4) information regarding historical LGBTQ+ events. For NPC 1, a text pop-up will appear, and the user will be able to type into a field and then press a button to submit their thoughts/answer. For NPC 2, I will try to utilize the Masonry library to display information in a grid.</p>

    <p><b>Experience Goals:</b> I hope to give users a space in which they are able to openly express their thoughts regarding such an important topic, and also allow others to find a source of comfort and acceptance in the kind thoughts that others have left before them.</p>
