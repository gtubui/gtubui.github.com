            <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/americans-are-identifying-lgbtq-more-ever-poll-finds-n1258627">Avery, Dan. “Americans are identifying as LGBTQ more than ever, poll finds.” 24 Feb. 
            2021. NBC News.</a> <br><br>
            The main focus of this article is the fact that there is a rise in Americans identifying as LGBTQ. This information could be helpful in aiding me formulate more questions to ask the user in order to collect data in my project. The statistics represented show 5.6% of Americans 18+ identify as LGBTQ, while of those who are part Generation Z (ages 18-23) 16% identify as LGBTQ. The article also claims that younger Americans are more willing to be open about their identity because nowadays, it is less “taboo.” I think this will be something interesting to consider while creating my project.

            <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/historical-lgbt-figures-activists-culture">McAndrews, Mary Beth. “12 historic LGBTQ figures who changed the world.” 18 June 
            2018. National Geographic.</a> <br><br>
            The figures who the author names are Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, Josephine Baker, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Michael Dillon, Virginia Woolf, Bayard Rustin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo, Nancy Cárdenas, Simon Nkoli, and Ifti Nasim. These figures included a drag queen, sex worker, singer, danger, scientific scholar, doctor, writer, painter, playwright, director, and poet. I think it’s interesting to note the wide diversity in race and background amongst all of these key figures.

                2019. Teen Vogue.</a> <br><br>
                As the title suggests, the author goes over 20 key moments in LGBTQ+ history that have contributed to where we are now. For my project, I was thinking about having an NPC that educates the player on past events when the player interacts with them (most likely by stating one fact from a series of facts each time the player interacts with the NPC). It might be important to note that the article only addresses key moments in American history – not across the world.
