                <p>The goal of this project was to create an application that would encourage others outside of the LGBTQ+ community to look at the community in a different light. However, while the development of this project progressed, the weight of the possibility of the project instead having a negative impact influenced my decision to switch to a more broad topic.</p>
                <p>While I did want to address a topic that was more personal to my experience, I was not confident enough in my abilities to be able to put together a project within the given amount of time that would actually achieve something that I would be proud of. Furthermore, I found it difficult to come up with questions that would not cause the user to feel as if there were a “correct” answer. As a result, the final product of the project ended up being a broad question that would allow others to contemplate on the question: “What is love to you?”</p>
                <p>I have found that many people find it difficult to be vulnerable with themselves or others. Consequently, they shield themselves from their true emotions, which arguably contributes to a lowered sense of empathy. I wanted to attempt to undo this uncomfortability with being vulnerable, thus the reason I decided on the question “What is love to you?”</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Initially, I started my research on individuals within the LGBTQ+ community because it was not until later on that I decided to switch my topic. This can be seen in my annotated bibliography. While this research did not directly affect my project, I did find it interesting how there was such a diverse background of historic and influential individuals within the LGBTQ+ community. To me, this showed that in the end, we really are all just human-beings who share the same experiences one way or another.</p>
                <p>In my comparative analysis, I looked at the games <i>Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to)</i> and <i>Inscryption</i>. At the barebones, <i>Kind Words</i> was pretty similar to what I wanted to achieve, in that players are able to submit their own data, and then that data is recorded and then able to be accessed by other players. <i>Inscryption</i> also had a function during a certain boss fight that worked like this. As a result, I was given ideas on how data was retrieved and manipulated in two drastically different ways that allowed me to consider different creative alternatives.</p>

                <p>From the start, I had a pretty basic idea of what I wanted to achieve with my project. Since in my previous mini-project (pictured on the left) I worked with 2D character animation, I wanted to try to create a little game-inspired interface. Originally, I had intended to implement at least four NPCs (non-playable characters): one for data collection, one for displaying data, and two others for some “fun facts'' regarding historic events and figures that affected the LGBTQ+ community. However, after I switched my project topic, I decided to just go with the initial two NPCs.</p>
                <p>In terms of functionality, the user is able to control a little character with the [A] [D] or left and right arrow keys. If they wanted to interact with NPCs, they would be able to if they press enter when near them which would then bring up a dialogue box. Initially, I wanted the user to be able to select options within the dialogue box with the arrow keys like in actual video games, however, I thought that would be a little bit too difficult for me to figure out at the time, so I just went with mouse-interactive / clickable buttons.</p>

                    <p>When it came time to test my project, I didn’t have all the visuals ready but I had the main functions working properly – the data collection and displaying data. The tasks I wanted the testers to complete were pretty straight forward:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Submit a response.</li>
                        <li>View the response library.</li>

                <p>I found that sometimes, the submit button or pulling up the response library would lag, so I added another set of text as a buffer. One of my testers also pointed out that the cursor wasn’t changing to a pointer on hover, that I should also include the ability to use the ESC to close dialogue / windows, space out the NPCs more, disable moving when a dialogue window is open, and make the dialogue box less transparent – all of which I implemented. </p>
                <p>The main notable difference between usability testing and the final product was that I added a character selection screen and got rid of the “rat hat” character, which in truth was mainly only made as a way for me to combat art block. I also added the NPC portraits to the dialogue box, adjusted the NPC sprites a bit and added idle animation to them, as well as added a small animation to the sources page. Furthermore, I noticed that everyone was putting generic answers, so I added another line of text that asks the user to be as sincere as possible.</p>

                <p>If I were to improve upon this project in the future, I would mainly like to try to figure out how to allow character customization, as well as create a more detailed and animated background. I learned a lot from this project, primarily how to store data and how to retrieve that stored data to be displayed. While there are a lot of things that could be improved, I am satisfied and proud of the final product.</p>
